   (that is a structure containing the best relevant solutions) and
   produces the car-bike plot. This plot provides a concise summary of the
   best relevant solutions. This plot shows on the horizontal axis the
   value of $c_{det}$ and $c_{shw}$ restriction factors and on the
   vertical axis the value of $k$. For each solution we draw two rectangle
   (associated with  $c_{det}$ and $c_{shw}$) which are respectively
   referred to interval of values for which the solution is best and
   stable and a horizontal line which departs from the rectangle for the
   values of $c_{det}$ ($c_{shw}$) in which the solution is only stable.
   Finally, for the best value of $c_{det}$ ($c_{shw}$) associated to the
   solution, we show a circle with a  number indicating the ranked
   solution among those which are not spurious. This plot has been
   baptized ``car-bike'', because the first best solutions (in general 2
   or 3) are generally best and stable for a large number of values of $c$
   and therefore will have large rectangles. In addition, these solutions
   are likely to be stable for additional values of $c_det$ ($c_{shw}$)
   and therefore are likely to have horizontal lines departing from the
   rectangles (from here the name ``cars''). Finally, local minor
   solutions (which are associated with particular values of $c_{det}$
   ($c_{shw}$) and $k$) do not generally present rectangles or lines and
   are shown with circles (from here the name ``bikes'')</P><h2>References</h2><P>Cerioli, A. Garcia-Escudero, L.A., Mayo-Iscar, A. and Riani, M. (2017),
