	<h2 id="f57140" class="title">Introduction to the Forward Search philosophy of data 
analysis</h2>
<p>To introduce the rationale of our statistical approach, we consider a very basic 
goal, that is estimation of a parameter of interest µ (for example the mean of the 
population). The frequentist approach to statistical inference treats µ as an unknown 
constant. Furthermore it requires the specification of a family of models which 
are indexed by µ and uses the sample data to answer questions about µ and the model 
itself (Cox 2006). If the data do not contain outliers strong arguments can be produced 
for representing the data by their mean. That is, all information on µ given by 
the sample y<sub>1</sub>, … , y<sub>n</sub> is conveyed by the function M(y)= (1/n) 
∑ y<sub>i</sub>. However, if the family of models is more sophisticated and allows 
the data to be contaminated from another distribution, a more complex function than 
the sample mean should be used to represent the data. One example of such a function 
is the trimmed mean, other examples are the M-estimator of location and the sample 
median (e.g. Maronna <em>et al., 2006</em>). All these functions originate from 
the pioneering work on robust statistics of Peter Huber and Frank Hampel in the 
1970s and try to take into account the fact that the data under study may contain 
outliers. </p>
<p>To obtain robust estimates of the unknown parameter µ we thus need to follow 
one of the following strategies: </p>
<p>a) Use a reduced number of observations in order to exclude outliers; </p>
<p>b) Down-weight each observation according to its deviation from the centre;
</p>
<p>c) Optimize an objective function which is more robust than the classical least-squares.
</p>
<p>However, in all instances the simplicity of the sample mean is lost. Further 
disadvantages of these approaches are the fact that the percentage of observations 
to be discarded for estimation of µ needs to be fixed in advance (strategy a), that 
there is no universally accepted way to downweight observations (strategy b), and 
that optimization of complex functions may cause severe computational problems. 
Another fundamental shortcoming common to all the robust strategies described above 
is that their extension to complex problems such as those originating from serial 
and spatial correlation, the heterogeneity of data, etc. is difficult and requires 
ad hoc strategies for each specific problem. </p>
<p>Therefore, no single available robust technique can deal simultaneously with 
all the complexity features described above and provide the user with a unified 
view of the available data. Finally, the researcher loses the connection of the 
effect that each observation exerts on the estimates of the parameters in the proposed 
model. In the previous example of the estimation of µ, whatever approach is used 
the researcher loses the information that each observation, outlier or not, has 
on the final proposed estimate. </p>
<p>Our approach to data analysis and inference is different. Although, as in robust 
statistics, we are concerned with the effect that outliers may have on estimation 
and on other inferential problems, we want to have a tool that preserves the interpretative 
and computational simplicity of the sample mean, thus keeping its high efficiency 
when the basic uncontaminated model is true. More importantly, we think that it 
is extremely important to develop a statistical approach that can attack relevant 
inferential issues in a unified way, as described in the international trade example. 
We achieve this goal by basing our inference on carefully chosen subsets of the 
data. The key difference with respect to the robust strategy is that we do not choose 
just one subsample, but we fit a sequence of subsets and let the data decide which 
is best for the model under study. </p>
<p>This approach, known in the statistical literature as the forward search (FS), 
preserves robustness to departures from the underlying null model, because outliers 
and other observations not fitting this model are not present in the best subsample. 
It also ensures high efficiency because we only discard those observations while 
including all the “good” ones. Furthermore, the forward search is very flexible 
and can be tuned to solve apparently different statistical issues through the definition 
of powerful problem-specific diagnostic quantities. </p>
<p>At this point we would like to stress that we are not proposing a simple new 
algorithm but we are suggesting a new philosophy of looking at the data. Up to 30 
years ago the absence of powerful computers prevented statisticians from diagnostic 
investigation of their models. The advent of powerful computers has made feasible 
the use of computationally intensive robust methods which minimize criteria different 
from the sum of squares. Both in the use of traditional robust and non-robust statistical 
methods, researchers end up with a picture of the data. Results obtained via a robust 
method are sometimes completely different and this causes dismay. </p>
<p><strong>Our philosophy involves watching a film of the data rather than a snapshot. 
In other words, the crucial idea of the forward search is to monitor how the fitted 
model changes whenever a new statistical unit is added to the subset. </strong>
</p>
<p>In the last ten years we have translated this concept into statistical terms, 
that is providing “forward confidence bands” in order to understand, from an inferential 
point of view, whether a new observation is in agreement with those previously included 
in the subset. In the problem of estimation of the mean, traditional statistical 
methods force all observations to be treated equally. Traditional robust methods 
allow differential treatment of the observations by use of iterative processes whose 
output sometimes seems to come from a black box. On the contrary, with our flexible, 
data-driven trimming resulting from the forward search, we can appraise the effect 
that each statistical unit (once it is introduced into the subset), outlier or not, 
leverage point or not, exerts on the fitted model. In other words, with our new 
philosophy we observe a film in which the different scenes are the individual observations. 
Thus, in our approach it is possible to understand the effect that each unit exerts 
on the fitted model. </p>
<p>In the rest of this section we present the main ideas of the forward search in 
linear regression and multivariate analysis together with the key mathematical 
aspects of this approach.</p>

If the values of the parameters of the model were known, there would
be no difficulty in detecting the outliers, which would have large residuals.
The difficulty arises because the outliers are included in the data used to
estimate the parameters, which can then be badly biased. Most methods for
outlier detection therefore seek to divide the data into two parts, a larger
“clean” part and the outliers. The clean data are then used for parameter
estimation. Our method follows this prescription, our emphasis being on
parameter estimation once some of the data, including the outliers, have
been removed for the purpose of parameter estimation.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
We start with
a fit to very few observations and then successively fit to larger subsets. The
starting point is found by fitting to a large number of small subsets, using
methods from robust statistics to determine which subset fits best. We
then order all observations by closeness to this fitted model; for regression
models the residuals determine closeness. The subset
size is increased by one and the model refitted to the observations with the
smallest residuals for the increased subset size. Usually one observation
enters, but sometimes two or more enter the subset as one or more leave.
The process continues with increasing subset sizes until, finally, all the
data are fitted. As a result of this forward search we have an ordering of
the observations by closeness to the assumed model.
The ordering of the observations we achieve takes us from a very robust
fit to, for regression, ordinary least squares. If the model and data agree,
the robust and least squares fits will be similar, as will be the parameter
estimates and residuals from the two fits. But often the estimates and
residuals of the fitted model change appreciably during the forward search.
We monitor the changes in these quantities and in various statistics, such
as score tests for transformation, as we move forward through the data,
adding one observation at a time. As we show, this forward procedure provides
a wealth of information not only for outlier detection but, much more
importantly, on the effect of each observation on aspects of inference about
the model.

<p>In the regression model </p>
<img src="plots/wpjcngj3.gif">
<p><em>y</em> is the <em>n</em>×1 vector of responses, <em>X</em> is an <em>n</em>-by-<em>p</em> full-rank matrix of known 
constants, with ith row <img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/img8.gif">, and β 
is a vector of <em>p</em> unknown parameters. The normal theory assumptions are that the 
errors <em>ɛ</em><sub>i</sub> are i.i.d. N(0,σ<sup>2</sup>). The least squares 
estimator of <em>β</em> is <img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/imgF.gif"> Then the vector of 
<em>n</em> least squares residuals is </p>
<p><img src="plots/wpalwc8l.gif"> </p>
<p>where <img alt="" src="plots/img3F.gif"> is the ‘hat" matrix, with diagonal elements hi and off-diagonal 
elements h<sub>ij</sub>. The residual mean square estimator of σ<sup>2</sup> is </p>
<p><img alt="" src="plots/img42.gif"></p>
<p>The forward search in linear regression starts from a small, robustly chosen, 
subset of the data that is clear of outliers and fits subsets of increasing size. 
Each observation is tested for outlyingness before it is included in the fitted 
subset. The likelihood ratio test for agreement of the new observation with those 
already in the subset reduces to the well-known deletion residual. As the subset 
size increases, the method of fitting moves from very robust to highly efficient 
likelihood methods. The FS thus provides a data dependent compromise between robustness 
and statistical efficiency. </p>
<p>Let <img alt="" src="plots/img43.gif"> be the subset of size m found by the 
forward search, for which the matrix of regressors is <em>X</em><sub><sub>*</sub></sub>(<em>m</em>). 
Least squares on this subset of observations yields parameter estimates
<img alt=""  class="style1" src="plots/img45.gif"> and <img alt=""  class="style1" src="plots/img47.gif">, the mean square estimate of σ<sup>2</sup> 
on <em>m &minus; p </em>degrees of freedom. Residuals can be calculated for all observations 
including those not in <img alt="" src="plots/img49.gif"> . The <em>n </em>resulting least squares residuals are</p>
<p><img alt="" src="plots/img4B.gif"></p>
<p>The search moves forward with the augmented subset
<img alt=""  class="style1" src="plots/img4D.gif"> consisting 
of the observations with the <em>m</em> + 1 smallest absolute values of 
<img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/img4F.gif">. 
The estimates of the parameters are based only on those observations giving the 
central m residuals. </p>
<p>To start we take <em>m<sub>0</sub></em> = <em>p</em> and search over subsets of 
<em>p</em> observations to find the 
subset, out of 3,000, that yields the least median of squares (LMS) estimate of 
<em>β</em>&nbsp; (Rousseeuw 1984). Although this initial estimator is not √ n-consistent 
(Hawkins and Olive 2002) our results show that the initial estimator is not important, 
provided masking is broken. Identical inferences are obtained using the least trimmed 
squares estimator except sometimes when m is small and <em>n</em>/<em>p</em><5. Random starting 
subsets also yield indistinguishable results over the last one third of the search. 
Examples for multivariate data are in Atkinson et al. (2006). The forward search, 
adding, and sometimes deleting, observations provides a bridge between the initial 
estimate and √ n-consistent parameter estimates for the uncontaminated observations 
as the sample size goes to infinity, in a similar way to the estimators discussed 
in Maronna and Yohai (2002).</p>

<h2 id="mult" class="title">The Forward Search in multivariate analysis</h2>

<h3 id="multdet" class="title">Basic ideas</h3>

<strong>Starting the Search.</strong> In presence of a <em>v</em> variables we find a small subset of size m<sub>0</sub> which is outlier free. A size of 3<em>v</em>
may be appropriate, although the size is not crucial. In the
univariate example we could  take the median observation and one
observation either side and use these observations to estimate the
mean and variance. This subset will be at the center of a
univariate distribution with some outliers, from which it will be
far. They will therefore be clearly revealed by their large Mahalanobis distances.

In <em>v</em> dimensions we use medians as estimators of location and
find observations that are close to the median in all bivariate
plots of the data.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Progressing in the Search.</strong> Given a subset of size <em>m</em> we
estimate the parameters and  calculate all <em>n </em>Mahalanobis
distances. These are then ordered from smallest to largest and the
<em>m</em>+1 observations with the <em>m</em>+1 smallest distances form the new
subset. Here <em>m</em> runs from <em>m</em><sub>0</sub> to the fit to all observations
when <em>m</em> = <em>n</em>. Usually one observation is added at a time, but the
inclusion of an outlier can cause the ordering of the observations
to change, when more than one unit may enter. Of course, at least
one unit then has to leave the subset in order for the size to
increase by one unit. This change of order during the search is a
feature of multivariate data which we have stressed is absent in
the analysis of univariate data. <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Monitoring the Search.</strong> For each value of <em>m</em> we can look 
at the plot of all <em>n</em> Mahalanobis distances. If there are outliers they 
will have large distances during the early part of the search that decrease 
dramatically at the end as the outlying observations are included in the subset 
of observations used for parameter estimation. If our interest is in outlier 
detection we can also monitor, for example, the minimum Mahalanobis distance among units not in the subset.
If an outlier is about to enter, this distance will be large,
although it will decrease again as the search progresses if a
cluster of outliers join.


<h3 id="multmat" class="title">Mathematical details</h3>

The main tools that we use are the values of various Mahalanobis distances. The squared distances
for the sample are defined as
<p>
<img alt="" src="plots/img14.gif"></p>
where  <img alt="" class="style1"  src="plots/img18.gif">and <img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/img19.gif"> are the unbiased moment estimators of the mean and covariance matrix of the
n observations and y<sub>i</sub> is v×1.
In the forward search the parameters <em>μ</em> and <em>Σ</em> are estimated from
a subset of <em>m</em> observations, yielding estimates<p>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;<img alt="" src="plots/img1B1.gif"> with <img alt="" src="plots/img1D.gif"> and 
<img alt="" src="plots/img1F.gif"> with <img alt="" src="plots/img21.gif"><img alt="" src="plots/img23.gif">. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Note that here <em>y</em><sub>j</sub> and <em>y</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> are m×1. From this subset we obtain 
<em>n</em>
squared Mahalanobis distances
<p><img alt="" src="plots/img26.gif"></p>
Unlike other methods, in the
forward search we use many subsets for outlier detection, rather than one. The difference is
between viewing a movie and a single snapshot.
In the forward search we start with a subset of <em>m<sub>0</sub></em> observations which grows in size during
the search. When a subset <em>S</em>*(<em>m</em>) of <em>m</em> observations is used in fitting we order the squared
distances and take the observations corresponding to the <em>m</em>+1 smallest as the new subset
<em>S</em>*(<em>m</em>+1). Usually this process augments the subset by one observation, but sometimes two or
more observations enter as one or more leave. To start the procedure we find a starting subset
<em>S</em>*(<em>m<sub>0</sub></em>) that is not outlying in any two-dimensional projection of the data 
(Atkinson et al. (2004), section 2.13). We look at forward plots of quantities that are derived from the distances
<em>d</em><sub>i</sub>(<em>m</em>) in which the parameters are estimated from the observations in <em>S</em>*(<em>m</em>). These distances
for <em>i</em>not belonging to <em>S</em>*(<em>m</em>) tend to decrease as <em>n</em> increases. If interest is in the latter part of the search we may
use scaled distances<p><img alt="" src="plots/img2D.gif"></p>
&nbsp;where <img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/img2F.gif"> is the estimate of 
<img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/img31.gif"> at the end of the search.
To detect outliers all methods compare selected Mahalanobis distances with a threshold. We
examine the minimum Mahalanobis distance among observations that are not in the subset
<br><img alt="" src="plots/img33.gif"> <br>or its scaled version
<img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/img35.gif">. If this ordered observation [m+1] is an outlier relative to the other
m observations, this distance will be ‘large" compared with the maximum Mahalanobis distance
of observations in the subset.
In uncalibrated use of the distances <img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/img38.gif"> to detect outliers the decision whether a difference
in distances is ‘large" is subjective, without reference to any null distribution. Examples
include the data analyses in chapter 3 of Atkinson et al. (2004). Even if the asymptotic distribution
of the individual distances is determined, as in Clarke and Schubert (2006), we still need
to calibrate the complete search to provide an outlier test of ascertainable properties.
To calibrate the forward search and so to provide an objective basis for decisions about the
number of outliers in a sample we have found the distribution of
<img alt="" class="style1" src="plots/img38.gif">in the forward search.
