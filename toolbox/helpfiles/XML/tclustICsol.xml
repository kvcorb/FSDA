   <Title><!--This is simply the filename-->tclustICsol</Title>
   <Purpose><!--This is the second line of the .m file-->tclustICsol extracts a set of best relevant solutions
</Purpose>
   <Description><!--Description section-->tclustICsol takes as input the output of function tclustIC (that is a series of matrices which contain the values of the information criteria BIC/ICL/CLA for different values of k and c) and extracts the first best solutions. Two solutions are considered equivalent if the value of the adjusted Rand index (or the adjusted Fowlkes and Mallows index) is above a certain threshold. For each tentative solution the program checks the adjacent values of c for which the solution is stable. A matrix with adjusted Rand indexes is given for the extracted solutions.

Each row refers to a solution. The information which is stored in the columns is as follows.
1st col = scalar, value of k for which solution takes place;
2nd col = scalar, value of c for which solution takes place;
3rd col = row vector of length d which contains the values of c for which the solution is uniformly better.
4th col = row vector of length d+r which contains the values of c for which the solution is considered stable (i.e. for which the value of the adjusted Rand index (or the adjusted Fowlkes and Mallows index) does not go below the threshold defined in input option ThreshRandIndex).
5th col = string which contains 'true' or 'spurious'. The solution is labelled spurious if the value of the adjusted Rand index with the previous solutions is greater than ThreshRandIndex.
