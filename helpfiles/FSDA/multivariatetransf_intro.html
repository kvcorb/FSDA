<h2 class="title">Introduction to transformations in
multivariate analysis</h2>


<p>As we have already seen in the analysis of transformations in regression 
analysis, the analysis of data is often improved by using a transformation of 
the response rather than the original response itself.
</p>
<p>
In
the  extension of the Box and Cox (1964) family to multivariate responses
there is a vector &lambda; of v transformation parameters
&lambda;<sub>j</sub>, one for each of the v responses.  As before,  y<sub>i</sub> is the v × 1 vector of responses at observation i with y<sub>ij</sub> the
observation on response j. The normalized transformation of
y<sub>ij</sub> is given by</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="images_help/img19.gif"></p>
<p>where 
<img alt="" class="style1" src="images_help/img1C.gif"> 
is is the geometric mean of the jth response. The
value  &lambda;<sub><em>j</em></sub>  = 1 (<em>j</em> = 1,... , v) corresponds to no
transformation of any of the responses. If the transformed
observations are normally distributed with vector mean µ<sub>i</sub> for
the i-th observation and covariance matrix ∑, twice the
profile loglikelihood of the
observations is given by</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images_help/img20.gif">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this equation the parameter estimates
<img alt="" class="style1" src="images_help/img27.gif"> 
are found for fixed &lambda; and
e<sub>i</sub>(&lambda;) is the v × 1 vector of residuals for
observation i for the same value of &lambda;. As in
the analysis of univariate transformations, it makes no
difference in likelihood ratio tests for the value of &lambda;
whether we use the maximum likelihood estimator of ∑, or
the unbiased estimator ∑<sub>u</sub>. Suppose the maximum
likelihood estimator is used, so
<p>
<img src="images_help/wpslb5gm.gif">
</p>


When this estimate is  substituted in the previous equation, 
the profile
loglikelihood reduces to

<p><img src="images_help/wp7fussp.gif">
</p><p>So, to test the hypothesis &lambda; = &lambda;<sub>0</sub>, the
likelihood ratio test statistic for transformation becomes</p>

<p><img src="images_help/wp665hpf.gif"></p>

<p>is compared with the χ<sup>2</sup> distribution on v degrees of
freedom. In this equation 
<img alt="" src="images_help/imgD1.gif"> is the vector of v
parameter estimates maximising <em>L</em><sub>max</sub>, which is found by
numerical search. Replacement of 
<img alt="" class="style1" src="images_help/img3E.gif"> by the unbiased estimator 
results in the multiplication of each determinant by a factor which cancels, 
leaving the value of the statistic unchanged. There are two special cases when 
tests of the form of T<sub>LR</sub> are on one degree of freedom. In the first we test 
that all responses should have the same, unspecified, transformation, that is that &lambda;<sub>1</sub> =
&lambda;<sub>2</sub> = ...  = &lambda;<sub>v</sub> = &lambda;. The second is
the test of just one component of &lambda; when all others are
kept at some specified value.  In both cases we sometimes plot
T<sub>N</sub>, the signed square root form of these tests is used.</p>

<p>For transformations of a single variable we use forward plots of
the <a href="fanplot.html">score statistic</a> T<sub>p</sub>(&lambda;). However, influential
observations may only be evident for some transformations of the
data, but not others. Therefore, we employ the forward search on
untransformed  data and on data subject to various
transformations. In other words, with just one variable for transformation it is
easy to use the fan plot from the five forward searches with
standard values of &lambda; to find satisfactory transformations,
if such exist, and to discover the observations that are
influential in their choice. However, with v variables for
transformation, there are 5<sup><em>v</em></sup> combinations of the five standard
values to be investigated. Whether or not the calculations are
time consuming, trying to absorb and sort the information would be
difficult. We therefore suggest three steps to help structure the
search for a multivariate transformation: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Run a forward search through the untransformed data,
ordering the observations at each m by Mahalanobis distances
calculated from untransformed observations. Estimate &lambda; at
each value of m. Use the forward plot of  
<img alt="" src="images_help/imgD1.gif"> to
select a set of&nbsp; transformation parameters.</li>
	<li>Rerun the forward
search, now ordering the observations by distances calculated with
the parameters selected in the first step;  &lambda; is again
estimated  for each m. As the search is now on transformed data,
the order in which the observations enter the subset will have
changed from that in Step 1. Again monitor the values of
<img alt="" src="images_help/imgD1.gif"> and of the likelihood ratio test for the
transformation. If a correct transformation has been found, the
parameter estimates, if
well defined, will be stable until near the end of the search,
when any outliers start to enter. At this point, the value of the
test statistic may increase rapidly.  How well defined the
parameter estimates are can be determined by
plots of profile loglikelihoods against the individual values of &lambda; for
various values of <em>m</em>. A flat likelihood will explain an estimate
of &lambda; which is behaving erratically.

 If some change is suggested in &lambda;, perhaps
because outliers appear to be entering before the end of the
search, repeat Step 2 until a reasonable set of transformations
has been found. Let this be &lambda;<sub>R</sub>.
 </li>
	<li>&nbsp;Confirmatory
testing of the suggested transformation. We expand each
transformation parameter in turn around the five common values of
&lambda; (-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1), using the values of the vector
&lambda;<sub>R</sub> for transforming the other <em>v</em>-1 variables. In this
way we turn a multivariate problem into a series of v univariate
ones. In each search we can test the transformation by comparing
the likelihood ratio test with χ<sup>2</sup> on 1 degree of freedom. But we use 
	the signed square root of the likelihood ratio&nbsp; in
order to learn whether lower or higher values of &lambda; are
indicated. The plot is thus a version of the fan plot.
</li>
</ol>
In Step 1 the search using untransformed data could be replaced by
one using a preliminary estimate of the vector of transformations,
perhaps from univariate estimation on each response separately.
Some iteration may be needed between Steps 2 and
3. <br><br>
<p>In summary, for the analysis of multivariate transformations we monitor forward plots of 
parameter estimates and likelihood ratio tests for the vector parameter λ. We 
produce the fan plot using the multivariate version of the signed square root 
form of the univariate likelihood ratio test. We
calculate a set of tests by varying each component of &lambda;
about &lambda;<sub>0</sub>. Suppose we require a fan plot for &lambda;<sub>j</sub>.
Let &lambda;<sub>0(j)</sub> be the vector of all parameters in
&lambda;<sub>0</sub> except &lambda;<sub>j</sub>. Then &lambda;<sub>0(j)</sub> =
(&lambda;<sub>0(j)</sub>:λ<sub>j</sub><sup>S</sup>) is the vector of parameter values
in which &lambda;<sub>j</sub> takes one of the five standard values λ<sup>S</sup> while the other parameters keep their values in
&lambda;<sub>0</sub>. To form the likelihood ratio test we also require the
estimator<sub><img alt="" src="images_help/imgD1.gif">0(j)</sub>&nbsp; found by maximization only over
&lambda;<sub>j</sub>. More explicitly, we can write  
<img alt="" src="images_help/imgD1.gif"><sub>0j</sub> = (λ<sub>0(j)</sub>:<img alt="" src="images_help/imgD1.gif"><sub>j</sub>). 
Then the version, for multivariate data, of the signed square root likelihood 
ratio test is</p>

<p>
<img src="images_help/wp6rxl09.gif">
</p>
<p>
We produce <em>v</em> fan plots, one for each variable, by letting
&lambda;<sub>j</sub>, <em>j</em> = 1,... ,<em>v</em> take each of the five standard values. 
Alternatively, particularly if numerical maximization of the likelihood is time 
consuming, we could produce the fan plot from the signed square root of the 
score test .
