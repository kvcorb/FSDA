        Sound, North Carolina. Analysis of the data was originally undertaken
        as part of a project for forecasting the shrimp harvest. The response
        is the biweekly average of salinity. There are three explanatory
        variables: the salinity in the previous two-week time period, a dummy
        variable for the time period during March and April and the river

        The data seem to include one outlier. This could either be omitted, or

        unconverted up a stack, or chimney. <br>
        The air flow (x1) measures the rate of operation of the plant. The
        nitric oxides produced are absorbed in a countercurrent absorption
        tower; x2 is the inlet temperature of cooling water circulating through
        coils in this tower and x3 is proportional to the concentration of acid
        in the tower. Small values of the response correspond to efficient
        absorption of the nitric oxides. Standard statistical techniques
        identify some observations as outliers. However through FS plots of
        t-statistics, R2 and leverage it is possible to identify a more complex
