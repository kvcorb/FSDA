   <Title><!--This is simply the filename-->carbikeplot</Title>
   <Purpose><!--This is the second line of the .m file-->carbikeplot produces the carbike plot to find best relevant clustering solutions
</Purpose>
   <Description><!--Description section-->carbikeplot takes as input the output of function tclustICsol (that is a structure containing the best relevant solutions) and produces the car-bike plot. This plot provides a concise summary of the best relevant solutions. This plot shows on the horizontal axis the value of $c$ and on the vertical axis the value of $k$. For each solution we draw a rectangle for the interval of values for which the solution is best and stable and a horizontal line which departs from the rectangle for the values of $c$ in which the solution is only stable. Finally, for the best value of $c$ associated to the solution, we show a circle with two numbers, the first number indicates the ranked solution among those which are not spurious and the second one the ranked number including the spurious solutions. This plot has been baptized ``car-bike'', because the first best solutions (in general 2 or 3) are generally best and stable for a large number of values of $c$ and therefore will have large rectangles. In addition, these solutions are likely to be stable for additional values of $c$ and therefore are likely to have horizontal lines departing from the rectangles (from here the name ``cars''). Finally, local minor solutions (which are associated with particular values of $c$ and $k$) do not generally present rectangles or lines and are shown with circles (from here the name ``bikes'')

         <ShortDesc>Relevant solutions produced by function tclustICsol.</ShortDesc>
         <TypeInd>Structure.</TypeInd>
         <LongDesc>It contains the following fields.
RelSol.MIXMIXbs = cell of size NumberOfBestSolutions-times-5 which contains the details of the best solutions for MIXMIX (BIC).
Each row refers to a solution. The information which is stored in the columns is as follows.
1st col = scalar, value of k for which solution takes place;
2nd col = scalar, value of c for which solution takes place;
3rd col = row vector of length d which contains the values of c for which the solution is uniformly better.
4th col = row vector of length d+r which contains the values of c for which the solution is considered stable (i.e. for which the value of the adjusted Rand index (or the adjusted Fowlkes and Mallows index) does not go below the threshold defined in input option ThreshRandIndex).
5th col = string which contains 'true' or 'spurious'. The solution is labelled spurious if the value of the adjusted Rand index with the previous solutions is greater than ThreshRandIndex.
Remark: field out.MIXMIXbs is present only if input option 'whichIC' is 'ALL' or 'whichIC' is 'MIXMIX'.
RelSol.MIXMIXbsari = matrix of adjusted Rand indexes (or Fowlkes and Mallows indexes) associated with the best solutions for MIXMIX. Matrix of size NumberOfBestSolutions-times-NumberOfBestSolutions whose i,j-th entry contains the adjusted Rand index between classification produced by solution i and solution j, $i,j=1, 2, \ldots, NumberOfBestSolutions$.
