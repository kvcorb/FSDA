	<h2 class="title">Technical introduction to Robust methods in multivariate analysis</h2>
	<a name="notation"></a>
	<h3 class="title">Notation</h3>
	Classical multivariate methods of estimation are based on the assumption of 
	an i.i.d. sample of observation Y={y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, ..., y<sub>n</sub>} 
	with each y<sub>i</sub> have a v-variate normal N<sub>v</sub>(µ, Ʃ) with density 
	f(y) given by
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img alt="" src="images_help/img114.gif"></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>where Ʃ =var(y) and |Ʃ| stands for the determinant Ʃ. If y is multivariate 
	normal for any constant vector a, all linear combinations a'y are normally distributed. 
	In addition given that conditional expectation of a subgroup of coordinate with 
	any other subgroup is a linear function of the latters, the type of dependence 
	among variables is linear. Thus, methods based on multivariate normality only 
	give information about linear relatioships among coordinates. As in the univariate 
	case, the main reason for this assumption is simplicity. </p>
	<p>If one dispersion matrix is a scalar multiple of another i.e. Ʃ<sub>2</sub> 
	= k Ʃ<sub>1</sub> we say that they have the same shape but a different size. 
	In what follows we denote with simbol
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img141.gif">the estimate of location, 
	with symbol <img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img2D.gif">the estimate 
	of the shape matrix and with symbol&nbsp;
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img13B.gif"> the estimate of the 
	covariance matrix where
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img31.gif">.</p>
	<p>As in the univariate case, one may consider the approach of outlier detection. 
	We are concerned with the case where a certain proportion of the observations 
	may not follow model above. The Mahalanobis distance (in squared units) between 
	the vectors y and µ with respect to matrix Ʃ is defined as </p>
	<p><img alt="" src="images_help/img130.gif"></p>
	<p><em>Remark</em>: the code to implement the Mahalanobis distances from a given 
	centroid and a scatter matrix (which are not necessarily the mean and the sample 
	covariance matrix) is implemented in function <a href="mahalfs.html">mahalFS</a>.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<a name="equivariance"></a>
	<h3 class="title">Affine equivariance</h3>
	Let <img class="style4" src="images_help/wp2ivoaz.gif"> be the location and 
	dispersion estimates corresponding to a sample Y={y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, 
	..., y<sub>n</sub>}, the estimates are affine equivariant if for each constant 
	vector <em>b</em> and matrix <em>A</em>:<p>
	<img alt="" src="images_help/img11D.gif"></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Affine equivariance is a natural property in those situations where it is 
	desirable that the reuslts remain essentially unchanged under any nonsingular 
	linear transformations, like linear discriminant analysis, canonical correlations 
	and factor analysis.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<a name="Mloc"></a>
	<h3 class="title">The multivariate M-estimate </h3>
	<p>In the regression case it was possible to define separately robust equivariant 
	estimate of location and of dispersion. This is more complicated to do in the 
	multivariate case, and if we require equivariant estimates it is better to estimate 
	location and dispersion simultaneously.</p>
	<p>The multivariate M-estimate of location and dispersion are defined as the 
	solution of the following system of equations (estimating equations)</p>
	<p><img alt="" src="images_help/img125.gif"></p>
	<p>where the functions <em>W</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>W</em><sub>2</sub> need 
	not to be equal. </p>
	<p>Remark 1: If function <em>W</em><sub>2</sub> is non decreasing, the solution 
	to this system of equation is called monotone multivaritate M estimates, while 
	if <em>W</em><sub>2</sub> is redescending the solutions are called redescending 
	multivariate M-estimates and must be defined by the minimization of&nbsp; some 
	objective function as it happens in the case of S estimates (which are introduced 
	in the next section). </p>
	<p>Remark 2: it is possible to show that the multivariate M estimates are affine 
	equivariant and asymptotically have a multivariate normal distribution. </p>
	<p>&nbsp; <a name="Msca"></a><a name="Sest"></a></p>
	<h3 class="title">The multivariate S-estimates and the MVE estimate</h3>
	Just as with the regression estimates where we aimed at making the residuals &quot;small&quot;, 
	we shall define multivaraite estimates of location and dispersion that make 
	the distances <em>d<sub>i</sub></em> small. To this purpose we look for
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img141.gif">and
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img34.gif"> minimizing some measures 
	of &quot;largeness&quot; of
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img13D.gif">. From the expression 
	of the Mahalanobis distance it is clear that the minimum can be trivially attained 
	by letting the smallest eigenvalue of
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img13B.gif" width="23"> tend to 
	zero. To prevent this, it is customary to impose the constraint
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img35.gif">. If we call with <em>
	S<sub>v</sub></em> the set of symmetric positive definite v x v shape matrices. 
	For a dataset Y call <img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img37.gif">the 
	vector with elements <img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img40.gif">with
	<em>i</em>=1, 2, ..., <em>n</em> and let <img src="images_help/wpwgl4jy.gif">be 
	a robust scale estimate.
	<p>Then we define the estimates
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img141.gif">and
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img2D.gif"> by </p>
	<p><img alt="" src="images_help/img70.gif"></p>
	<p>If we take for <img src="images_help/wpwgl4jy.gif"> an M scale estimate that 
	satisfies</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="86" src="images_help/imgC.gif" width="205"></p>
	<p class="style4">where ρ is a smooth bounded ρ-function, we obtain the class 
	of S estimates. If ρ is differentiable, it is easy to show that to solve the 
	minimization problem the solution must satisfy the so called M estimating equations. 
	So an S estimate&nbsp;
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img1E.gif">and
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img21.gif"> is also an M estimate.</p>
	<p class="style4">In other words, for any
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img57.gif">,
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img59.gif"> with
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img5B.gif">, and
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img5E.gif">the S estimates
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img1E.gif"> and
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img21.gif"> satisfy the following 
	inequality</p>
	<p class="style4"><img alt="" src="images_help/img69.gif"></p>
	<p class="style4">where&nbsp;
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img63.gif"> is the same in the denominator 
	on both sides of the equation. </p>
	<p>The S estimate of location
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img3F.gif">, scale
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img41.gif"> and shape
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img43.gif"> and consequently the 
	S estimate of the covariance matrix&nbsp;
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img45.gif">can be found using routine
	<a href="smult.html">Smult</a>.</p>
	<p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If, we take for <img src="images_help/wpwgl4jy.gif"> (to mimic the approach 
	that results in the LMS in regression) the sample median of the Mahalanobis 
	distances, the resulting location and dispersion matrix estimate is called minimum 
	volume ellipsoid (MVE) estimate. The name comes from the fact that among all 
	ellipsoids {x: d(x,µ, Ʃ)} containing at least half of the data points, the one 
	given by the MVE estimate has minimum volume (i.e. minimum |Ʃ|).</p>
	<p>The MVE estimate of location
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img28.gif"> and&nbsp; of the covariance 
	matrix&nbsp;
	<img alt="" class="style4" height="33" src="images_help/img29.gif" width="77">can 
	be found using routine <a href="mve.html">mve</a>.</p>

	<a name="Lest"></a>
	<h3 class="title">The multivariate L-estimates of scale the MCD estimate
	</h3>
	<p>An alternative to using an M-scale or the median of the distances, we can 
	use a trimmed scale for <img src="images_help/wpwgl4jy.gif"> (as it was done 
	in regression to define the LTS estimate). More formally, let </p>
	<p><img alt="" src="images_help/img12.gif"></p>
	<p>be the ordered values of the squared distances <em>d</em><sub>i</sub>=<em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>i</sub>, 
	µ, Γ), and for 1 &lt;<em>h</em>&lt;<em>n</em> define the trimmed scale of the 
	squared distances as:</p>
	<p><img alt="" src="images_help/img62.gif"></p>
	<p>An estimate <img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img141.gif">,<img alt="" src="images_help/img13B.gif"> 
	based on this trimmed scale is called a minimum covariance determinant (MCD) 
	estimate. The reason for this name is the following: for each ellipsoid {x: 
	d(x, t, V)} we can compute the covariance matrix C of the data points in the 
	ellipsoid. If&nbsp; <img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img141.gif">,<img alt="" src="images_help/img13B.gif"> 
	is an MCD estimate, the ellipsoid with t=<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img22.gif"> 
	and V equal to a scalar multiple of
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img24.gif"> minimizes |C|. </p>
	<p>The MCD estimate of location
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img22.gif"> and&nbsp; of the covariance 
	matrix&nbsp; <img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img24.gif"> can be 
	found using routine <a href="mcd.html">mcd</a>. For each elemental subset which 
	is extracted (which satisfies certain conditions) we compute the minimum value 
	of the determinant checking for singularity. For the subsets with the 5 best 
	(bestr) minimum values of the determinant a series of refining steps (C-steps) 
	are done.</p>
	<a name="MMest"></a>
	<h3 class="title">The multivariate MM-estimate </h3>
	<p>The MM-regression estimator of location and shape is defined as the minimum 
	of the following <em>f</em> function</p>
	<p><img alt="" src="images_help/img65.gif"></p>
	<p>where ρ<sub>2</sub> is possibly another ρ function which provides higher 
	efficiency than the previous ρ at the null multivariate normal model. Function
	<em>f</em> is minimized with respect to µ and Ʃ for fixed
	<img class="style4" src="images_help/regres2.gif">.&nbsp; In this equation
	<img src="images_help/wpwgl4jy.gif"> is any auxiliary robust scale estimate, 
	however it is common to use
	<img class="style4" src="images_help/wp0pxcx5.gif"> and, as starting values 
	of location and shape, those which come out from the S estimator (that is&nbsp;<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img3F.gif"> 
	and <img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img43.gif">) .</p>
	<img alt="" src="images_help/img76.gif"> and
	<img alt="" class="style4" src="images_help/img77.gif"> can be computed using 
	routines <a href="mmmult.html">MMmult</a> and <a href="mmmultcore.html">MMmultcore</a>. 
	More precisely, MMmultcore assumes that user supplies an estimate of σ, µ and 
	Γ; on the other hand, function MMmult uses function <a href="smult.html">Smult</a> 
	to preliminary compute an estimate of σ, µ and Γ
