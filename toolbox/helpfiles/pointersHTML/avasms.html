   augmented star plot.

 Below we list the five options giving an informative text description
 followed by the optional input arguments. We also give in parenthesis, the
 abbreviations used in the augmented star plot, where these are different.

 - Robustness (rob).
 - Remove effect of order of explanatory variables by regression (scail).
 - Trapezoidal or rectangular rule for numerical integration in function
   ctsub (trapezoid).
 - Ordering inclusion of the variables in the backfitting algorithm using
   $R^2$ values (orderR2).
 - Initial robust transformation of the response (tyinitial).

 We reduce the number of analyses for investigation by removing all those
 for which the residuals fail the Durbin-Watson and Jarque-Bera tests, at
 the 10 per cent level (two-sided for Durbin-Watson). Unlike the
 Durbin-Watson test, the Jarque-Bera test uses a combination of estimated
 skewness and kurtosis to test for distributional shape of the residuals.
 Note that this threshold of 10 per cent can be changed using optional
 input argument critBestSol.

 We order the solutions by the Durbin-Watson significance level multiplied
 by the value of $R^2$ and by the number of units not declared as
 outliers. The rays in individual plots are of equal length for those
 features used in an analysis. All rays are in identical places in each
 plot. Information in the plot is augmented by making the length of the
 rays for each analysis reflect the properties of the analysis; they are
 proportional to $p_{DW}$, the significance level of the Durbin-Watson
 test. Note that the ordering in which the solutions are displayed in the
 plot can be changed using optional input argument SolutionOrdering.

 The five options start on the right and wind counterclockwise in steps of
 72 degrees around the circle. The ordering in which the five options are
 displayed in the plot depends on the frequency of presence among the set
 of the admissible solutions. For example, if robustness is the one who
 has the highest frequency, its spoke is shown on the right (plotted to
 the East). The second most present option is shown on the top right...
 and the least present option is shown on the bottom right.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>
 Routine avas, (additivity and variance stabilization) provides
 non-parametric alternatives to the widely used Box-Cox parametric
 transformation of the response and the Box-Tidwell family of power
 transformations of explanatory variables. In routine avas it is possible:

 [1] To use option rob in order to replace standard OLS regression with
 robust regression in all steps of the iterative procedure. More precisely
 using robust regression we identify a subset $S_m$ of clean observations
 to use in the backfitting algorithm to calculate the transformations
 $f(X)$ at each iteration, the $n-m$ outliers being ignored. We also use
 the subset in function ctsub in the calculation of the numerical variance
 stabilising transformation. Since different response transformations can
 indicate different observations as outliers, the identification of
 outliers occurs repeatedly during our robust algorithm, once per
 iteration.

 [2] To use option scail in order to linearly transform the explanatory
 variables in order to let each column of matrix X have the same weight
 when predicting g(y).

 [3] To use option orderR2 to completely eliminate dependence on
 the order of the variables. That is, in each iteration of the backfitting
 algorithm we impose an ordering which is based on the variable which
 produces the highest increment of $R^2$.

 [4] To use option tyinitial which calculates a robust parametric
 transformation of the response before starting the main backfitting loop.

 [5] To use option trapeziod in order to specify how to compute the
 integral to obtain transformed values for the units which fall outside
 the range of integration determined by the units not declared as
 outliers.

 The purpose of this routine is to apply avas with and without the five
 options listed above. There are therefore 32 combinations of options that
 could be chosen. It is not obvious that all will be necessary when
 analysing all sets of data. This routine returns the list of options
 which produced the best fit and provides the necessary ingredients for a
 graphical method, the augmented star plot, to indicate which options are
 important in a particular data analysis.
