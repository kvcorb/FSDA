%
% The purpose of this routine is to produce the constrained shape matrix
% $\Gamma$.
% This routine copes with the second of the 3 letters of modeltype. It
% deals with the cases in which the second letter is E, or I or V. If the
% second letter is V procedure restrshapecore is invoked and both (within
% groups) cshw, and (between groups) cshb constraints are imposed. If the
% second letter of modeltype is E just cshw is used. If the second letter
% is I, GAMc becomes a matrix of ones.
%
%

%     GAMc : constrained shape matrix. Matrix of size v-by-k containing in
%           column j the elements on the main diagonal of shape matrix
%           $\Gamma_j$. The elements of GAMc satisfy the following
%           constraints:
%           The product of the elements of each column is equal to 1.
%           The ratio among the largest elements of each column is
%           not greater than pa.shb.

%           The ratio among the smallest elements of each column is
%           not greater than pa.shb.
%           The ratio of the elements of each column is not greater than
%           pa.shw.
%           All the columns of matrix GAMc are equal if the second
%           letter of modeltype is E. All the columns of matrix GAMc are
%           equal to 1 if the second letter of modeltype is I. This matrix
%           will be an input of routine restrdeterGPCM.m to compute
%           constrained determinants.

function [GAMctrSRT]  = restrshapecore(GAMini, niini, shw, shb, zerotol, maxiterS, tolS, sortsh, userepmat)
% restrshapecore computes constrained Gamma (shape) matrix
%
% The purpose is to find the new constrained shape matrix.
% This routine is called when modeltype(2) = V (that is in presence of
% varying shape matrices). In order to impose both shw inside each group
% and shb between groups, a number of iterations specified by input
% parameter maxiterS and a stopping condition given by itertol are necessary .
%
% Required input arguments:
%
% GAMini  : matrix of size v-by-k
%           GAMini contains in the first column the elements on the
%           diagonal of GAM(:,:,1). In other words the first
%           column contains the diagonal elements of matrix
%           $\Gamma_1$
%           GAMini contains in the second column the elements on the
%           diagonal of GAM(:,:,2). In other words the first
%           column contains the diagonal elements of matrix
%           $\Gamma_2$
%           .........
%   niini  : vector of length k containing the size of the groups.
%     shw  : scalar greater or equal 1. Constraint to impose inside each
%           group. For example, if shw is 3 the ratio of each column of output
%           matrix GAMc will not be greater than 3.
%     shb  : scalar greater or equal 1. Constraint to impose among groups.
%           For example, if shb is 5 the ratio of each row of (sorted) output
%           matrix GAMc will not be greater than 5.
%  zerotol : scalar. Tolerance value to declare all input values equal to 0
%           in the eigenvalues restriction routine (file restreigen.m).
% maxiterS : maximum number of iterations in the iterative procedure.
%           Scalar.
%     tolS : tolerance to use to exit the iterative procedure. Scalar. The
%           iterative procedure stops when the relative difference of
%           output matrix GAMc is smaller than itertol in two consecutive
%           iterations or when maxiterS is reached.
%

% Output:
%

%           column j the elements on the main diagonal of shape matrix
%           $\Gamma_j$. The elements of GAMc satisfy the following
%           constraints:
%           The product of the elements of each column is equal to 1.
%           The ratio among the largest elements of each column is
%           not greater than pa.shb.
%           The ratio among the second largest elements of each column is
%           not greater than pa.shb.
%           ....
%           The ratio among the smallest elements of each column is
%           not greater than pa.shb.
