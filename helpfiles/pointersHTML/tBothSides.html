 There is sometimes a strong, often theoretically derived, relationship
 between the response and the model $\eta(x,\beta)$, combined with
 variance heterogeneity. Box-Cox transformation of the response to achieve
 stability of variance can destroy the relationship between E($Y$) and
 $\eta(x,\beta)$. For example, the kinetic models of chemistry provide
 deterministic relationships between concentrations of reactants and
 products and time and temperature. A well-known simple example is the
 Michaelis-Menten model for enzyme kinetics in which the response goes
 from zero to an asymptotic value $V_{\mbox{max}}$.  Transforming the
 response to $y^{\lambda}$ would result in a different range for the
 transformed response.
 
 Carrol and Ruppert (1988) [Chapter~4] developed a transform both sides
 model for such problems, motivated by theoretical models for sockeye
 salmon breeding. The transformation model is
  \begin{equation}
  \label{BSmodel}
  (y^{\lambda} - 1)/\lambda = \{\eta(x,\beta)^{\lambda} - 1\}/\lambda + \epsilon,
  \end{equation}
  where the independent errors are normally distributed. As with the
  Box-Cox transformation, the parameters $\lambda$ and $\beta$ are found
  by minimizing the residual sum of squares in the regression model which
  includes the Jacobian of the transformation, again $\dot{y}$.
  The theoretical procedure is to minimize the residual sum of squares
  using $y(\lambda)/\dot{y}^{\lambda -1}$, or equivalently
  $y(\lambda)/\dot{y}^{\lambda}$, as the response and the similarly
  transformed value of $\eta$ as the model. Carroll and Ruppert comment
  that, unless $\lambda$ is fixed, it is not possible to use standard
  nonlinear regression routines for this minimization as such  routings
  typically do not allow the response to depend upon unknown parameters.
  They reformulate the problem in terms of a `pseudo model'. This is what
  is implemented in this routine.
