   1) accepts an input X also as table;
   2) produces in table format the percentage of the variance explained
      single and cumulative of the various components and the associated
      scree plot, in order to decide about the number of components to
      retain.
   3) returns the loadings in table format and shows them graphically.
   4) provides guidelines about the automatic choice of the number of
       components;
   5) returns the communalities for each variable with respect to the
       first k principal components in table format;
   6) retuns the orthogonal distance ($OD_i$) of each observation to the
      PCA subspace. For example, if the subspace is defined by the first two
      principal components, $OD_i$ is computed as:
      \[
        OD_i=|| z_i- V_{(2)} V_{(2)}' z_i ||
      \]
      where z_i is the i-th row of the original centered data matrix $Z$ of
      dimension $n \times v$ and $V_{(2)}=(v_1 v_2)$ is the matrix of size
      $p \times 2$ containing the first two eigenvectors of $Z'Z/(n-1)$. The
      observations with large $OD_i$ are not well represented in the space of
      the principal components.
   7)  returns the score distance $SD_i$ of each observation. For example,
      if the subspace is defined by the first two principal components,
      $SD_i$ is computed as:
      \[
        SD_i=\sqrt{(z_i'v_1)^2/l_1+ (z_i'v_2)^2/l_2 }
      \]
      where $l_1$ and $l_2$ are the first two eigenvalues of $Z'Z/(n-1)$.
   8) calls app biplotFS which enables to obtain an interactive biplot in
      which points, rowslabels or arrows can be shown or hidden. This app
      also gives the possibility of controlling the length of the arrows
      and the position of the row points through two interactive slider
      bars. In the app it is also possible to color row points depending
      on the orthogonal distance ($OD_i$) of each observation to the PCA
      subspace. If optional input argument bsb or bdp is specified, it is
      possible to have in the app two tabs which enable the user to select
      the breakdown point of the analysis or the subset size to use in the
      svd. The units which are declared as outliers or the units outside
      the subset are shown in the biplot with filled circles.</P></html>
