 This procedure extends to tclustreg the so-called monitoring approach.
 The philosophy is to investigate how the results change as the trimming
 proportion alpha reduces. This function enables us to monitor the change
 in classification (measured by the ARI index) and the change in
 regression coefficients and error variances (measured by the relative
 squared Euclidean distances).
 Note that there is a non-identifiability of a finite mixture distribution
 caused by the invariance of the mixture density function to components
 relabeling. In order to make sure that consistent labels are used for the
 groups, between two consecutive values of alpha, we call
 we assign label r to a group if this group shows the smallest distance
 with group r for the previous value of alpha.
 More precisely, once the labelling is fixed for the largest value of the
 trimming factor supplied, if $\alpha_r$ and $\alpha_s$ denote two
 consecutive levels of trimming ($\alpha_r&gt;\alpha_s$) and
 \beta_{j,\alpha_r}
given \beta_{j,\alpha_r}

 In order to be consistent
 along the different runs it is possible to specify through option
 UnitsSameGroup the list of the units which must (whenever possible) have
 a particular label.
