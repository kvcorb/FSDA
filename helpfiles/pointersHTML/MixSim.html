﻿The fast algorithm for the medcouple (Brys G., Hubert M. and Struyf A., 
 2004) is a robust measure of skewness used to adjust the whiskers of a
 boxplot (Hubert M. and Vandervierenb E., 2008) and avoid wrong
 declaration of outliers in asymmetric univariate data. The medcouple
 replaces the classical skewness (that is based on the third moment of a
 data distribution) with a scaled median difference of the left and right
 half of the distribution. More precisely, it is defined as the median of
 the kernel function
 $h(z_i,z_j)=\frac{(z_j-median(z))-(median(z)-z_i)}{z_j-z_i}$ over all
 pairs $(z_i,z_j)$ where $z_i&lt;=median(z)$ and $z_j &gt;= median(z)$. The MATLAB
 toolbox LIBRA (http://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust.html) and the R package
 robustbase (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/robustbase) implement
 the fast medcouple with wrapper functions to the same compiled C source,
 to maximize speed. This medcouple.m function replicates faithfully the C
 function mlmc.c in pure MATLAB code, but replaces the key computations of
 the median and weighted median (which are intensively used) with calls to
 the FSDA functions quickselectFS and quickselectFSw or, optionally, to
 the $n\log n$ solution of Sven Haase (2022) weightedMedian.m. The result
 is a readable MATLAB function that does not ﻿sacrifices performance. The
 FSDA implementation also optimizes the computation of the medcouple
 kernel function, to take into account the case where there are multiple
 values equal to the median, the denominator becomes 0 and the kernel is
 therefore defined differently: we computed it efficiently in the
 sub-function calwork, using the signum function. The consistency of the
 MATLAB and original C implementations have been carefully verified with
 simulations that ensure the same random numbers generation in the two
 environments. The code that has been used can be found in the FSDA github
 project.
