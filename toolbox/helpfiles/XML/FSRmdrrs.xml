Rows of X represent observations, and columns represent variables. By default, there is a constant term in the model, unless you explicitly remove it using input option intercept, so do not include a column of 1s in X. Missing values (NaN's) and infinite values (Inf's) are allowed, since observations (rows) with missing or infinite values will automatically be excluded from the computations.</LongDesc>

         <Name>numpool</Name>
         <ShortDesc>use parallel computing and parfor.</ShortDesc>
         <TypeInd>Scalar.</TypeInd>
         <LongDesc>If numpool &amp;gt; 1, the routine automatically checks if the Parallel Computing Toolbox is installed and distributes the random starts over numpool parallel processes. If numpool &amp;lt;= 1, the random starts are run sequentially. By default, numpool is set equal to the number of physical cores available in the CPU (this choice may be inconvenient if other applications are running concurrently). The same happens if the numpool value chosen by the user exceeds the available number of cores.
REMARK 1: up to R2013b, there was a limitation on the maximum number of cores that could be addressed by the parallel processing toolbox (8 and, more recently, 12).
From R2014a, it is possible to run a local cluster of more than 12 workers.
REMARK 2: Unless you adjust the cluster profile, the default maximum number of workers is the same as the number of computational (physical) cores on the machine.
REMARK 3: In modern computers the number of logical cores is larger than the number of physical cores. By default, MATLAB is not using all logical cores because, normally, hyper-threading is enabled and some cores are reserved to this feature.
REMARK 4: It is because of Remarks 3 that we have chosen as default value for numpool the number of physical cores rather than the number of logical ones. The user can increase the number of parallel pool workers allocated to the multiple start monitoring by:
- setting the NumWorkers option in the local cluster profile settings to the number of logical cores (Remark 2). To do so go on the menu "Home|Parallel|Manage Cluster Profile" and set the desired "Number of workers to start on your local machine".
- setting numpool to the desired number of workers;
Therefore, *if a parallel pool is not already open*, UserOption numpool (if set) overwrites the number of workers set in the local/current profile. Similarly, the number of workers in the local/current profile overwrites default value of 'numpool' obtained as feature('numCores') (i.e. the number of physical cores).</LongDesc>

         <LongDesc>cleanpool is 1 (true) if the parallel pool has to be cleaned after the execution of the random starts. Otherwise it is 0 (false).
The default value of cleanpool is false.
Clearly this option has an effect just if previous option numpool is &amp;gt; 1.</LongDesc>

Therefore it is necessary to work in a folder where the user has write permission. If this is not the case and the user (say) is working without write permission in folder C:\Program Files\MATLAB the following message will appear on the screen:

If bsbsteps=0 BBrs has size n-by-(n-init+1)-by-nsimul.
In this case BBrs(:,:,j) with j=1, 2, ..., nsimul has the following structure:
1-st row has number 1 in correspondence of the steps in which unit 1 is included inside subset and a missing value for the other steps;
......
(n-1)-th row has number n-1 in correspondence of the steps in which unit n-1 is included inside subset and a missing value for the other steps;
n-th row has the number n in correspondence of the steps in which unit n is included inside subset and a missing value for the other steps.
If, on the other hand, bsbsteps is a vector which specifies the steps of the search in which it is necessary to store subset, BBrs has size n-by-length(bsbsteps)-by-nsimul.
In other words, BBrs(:,:,j) with j=1, 2, ..., nsimul has the same structure as before, but now contains just length(bsbsteps) columns.</LongDesc>

         <Title>Same example as before but now there is one group which has a size much greater than the other (n1=60 and n2=150).</Title>
         <Desc>
            <ItemCell>In this case it is possible to see that there is a trajectory of minimum deletion residual which goes outside the envelope in steps 60-110. This corresponds to the searches initialized using the units coming from the smaller group. Note that due to the partial overlapping after the peak in steps 60-110 there is a gradual decrease. When m is around 160, most of the units from this group tend to get out of the subset.</ItemCell>
            <ItemCell>Therefore the value of mdr becomes much smaller than it should be.</ItemCell>
            <ItemCell>Please note the dip around step m=165, which is due to entrance of the units of the second larger group. This trajectory just after the dip collapses into the trajectory which starts from the second group.</ItemCell>
            <ItemCell>Around steps 90-110 it is also possible to see two trajectories inside the bands which collaps into one around m=120. Please use mdrrsplot with option databrush in order to explore the units belonging to subset. Here we limit ourselves to notice that around m =180 all the units from second group are included into subset (plus some of group 1 given that the two groups partially overlap). Also notice once again the decrease in the unique trajectory of minimum deletion residual after m around 180 which is due to the entry of the units of the first smaller group.</ItemCell>
