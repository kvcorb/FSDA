   augmented star plot.

 Below we list the five options giving an informative text description
 followed by the optional input arguments. We also give in parenthesis, the
 abbreviations used in the augmented star plot, where these are different.

 - Robustness (rob).
 - Remove effect of order of explanatory variables by regression (scail).
 - Trapezoidal or rectangular rule for numerical integration in function
   ctsub (trapezoid).
 - Ordering inclusion of the variables in the backfitting algorithm using
   $R^2$ values (PredictorOrderR2).
 - Initial robust transformation of the response (tyinitial).

 We reduce the number of analyses for investigation by removing all those
 for which the residuals fail the Durbin-Watson and Jarque-Bera tests, at
 the 5 per cent level (two-sided for Durbin-Watson). Unlike the
 Durbin-Watson test, JarqueBera test uses a combination of estimated
 skewness and kurtosis to test for distributional shape of the residuals.
 We order the analyses by the Durbin-Watson significance level, from the
 largest value downwards. The rays in individual plots are of equal length
 for those features used in an analysis. Robustness is always plotted to
 the East and all rays are in identical places in each plot. Information
 in the plot is augmented by making the length of the rays for each
 analysis reflect the properties of the analysis; they are proportional to
 $p_{DW}$, the significance level of the Durbin-Watson test.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>
 Routine avas, (additivity and variance stabilization) provides
 non-parametric alternatives to the widely used Box-Cox parametric
 transformation of the response and the Box-Tidwell family of power
 transformations of explanatory variables. In routine avas it is possible:

 [1] To use option rob in order to replace standard OLS regression with
 robust regression in all steps of the iterative procedure. More precisely
 using robust regression we identify a subset $S_m$ of clean observations
 to use in the backfitting algorithm to calculate the transformations
 $f(X)$ at each iteration, the $n-m$ outliers being ignored. We also use
 the subset in function ctsub in the calculation of the numerical variance
 stabilising transformation. Since different response transformations can
 indicate different observations as outliers, the identification of
 outliers occurs repeatedly during our robust algorithm, once per
 iteration.

 [2] To use option scail in order to linearly transform the explanatory
 variables in order to let each column of matrix X have the same weight
 when predicting g(y).

 [3] To use option PredictorOrderR2 to completely eliminate dependence on
 the order of the variables. That is, in each iteration of the backfitting
 algorithm we impose an ordering which is based on the variable which
 produces the highest increment of $R^2$.

 [4] To use option tyinitial which calculates a robust parametric
 transformation of the response before starting the main backfitting loop.

 [5] To use option trapeziod in order to specify how to compute the
 integral to obtain transformed values for the units which fall outside
 the range of integration determined by the units not declared as
 outliers.

 The purpose of this routine is to apply avas with and without the five
 options listed above. There are therefore 32 combinations of options that
 could be chosen. It is not obvious that all will be necessary when
 analysing all sets of data. This routine returns the list of options
 which produced the best fit and provides the necessary ingredients for a
 graphical method, the augmented star plot, to indicate which options are
 important in a particular data analysis.
