	<h2>Key Features</h2>
	<p>FSDA Toolbox&#8482; provides statisticians, engineers, scientists, researchers, 
	financial analysts with a comprehensive set of tools to assess and understand 
	their data. Flexible Statistics Data Analysis Toolbox&#8482; software includes 
	functions and interactive tools for analyzing and modeling data, learning and 
	teaching statistics. </p>
	<p>The Flexible Statistics Data Analysis Toolbox&#8482; supports a set of routines 
	to develop robust and efficient regression analysis. In addition, it offers 
	a rich set interactive graphical tools which enable us to explore the connection 
	in the various features of the different forward plots. </p>
	<p>All Flexible Statistics Data Analysis Toolbox&#8482; functions are written 
	in the open MATLAB&#174; language. This means that you can inspect the algorithms, 
	modify the source code, and create your own custom functions. </p>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Analyze and model data using flexible, robust statistical methods</h3>
	<br>FSDA is a software library in support of a robust and efficient statistical 
	analysis of data sets, ensuring an output unaffected by anomalies in the provided 
	data or deviations from model assumptions. The tool:<br>• Is especially useful 
	in detecting in data potential anomalies (outliers), even when they occur in 
	groups.<br>• Can be used to identify sub-groups in heterogeneous data.<br>• 
	Extend functionalities in key statistical domains requiring robust analysis 
	(cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, model selection, data transformation).<br>
	• Integrate instruments for interactive data visualization and modern exploratory 
	data analysis, designed to simplify the interpretation of the statistical results 
	by the end user.<br>• Provides statisticians, engineers, scientists, financial 
	analysts a comprehensive set of tools to assess and understand their data.<br>
	• Provides practitioners, students and teachers with functions and graphical 
	tools for modeling complex data, learning and teaching statistics.<br>FSDA is 
	developed for wide applicability. For its capacity to address problems focusing 
	on anomalies in the data, it is expected that it will be used in applications 
	such as anti-fraud, detection of computer network intrusions, e-commerce and 
	credit cards frauds, customer and market segmentation, detection of spurious 
	signals in data acquisition systems, in chemometrics (a wide field covering 
	biochemistry, medicine, biology and chemical engineering), in issues related 
	to the production of official statistics (e.g. imputation and data quality checks), 
	and so on.<br>System requirements<br>FSDA:<br>• Works from the release R2009b 
	of MATLAB and uses its Statistics Toolbox.<br>• It has been tested on Microsoft 
	as well as UNIX (Linux and MacOsX) platforms.<br>• It can be installed in Windows 
	platforms automatically, with a setup program that also opens inside the MATLAB 
	editor files containing a series of examples of use in typical statistical problems.<br>
	• It can be installed in UNIX platforms manually, from a compressed tar-file.<br>
	• Works without major porting adaptations and with limitations on interactive 
	graphical functions in GNU OCTAVE. OCTAVE is a software development environment 
	mostly compatible with MATLAB, freely redistributable under the terms of the 
	GNU General Public License (GPL) of the Free Software Foundation (http://www.gnu.org/).<br>
	Main features<br>FSDA includes:<br>• Different categories of robust statistical 
	functions, covering:<br>- Regression analysis;<br>- Multivariate analysis;<br>
	- Data transformations in regression and multivariate applications;<br>- Model 
	selection;<br>- Clustering;<br>- Interactive statistical visualization.<br>• 
	Graphical user interfaces that allow exploring the main interactive graphics 
	features on plots generated by running different statistical functions.<br>• 
	Didactic material in the form of movies (with audio) that can be run in a browser 
	connected to the Internet.<br>• A rich collection of popular datasets provided 
	in different data formats and fully documented.<br>• A comprehensive documentation 
	system:<br>The head of each m-function describes the function purpose, the input–output 
	parameters, the bibliographic references, possible function dependencies, third 
	party acknowledgments and self-contained examples of use.<br>The corresponding 
	html documentation pages are obtained using a parser, publishFS.m, which is 
	able to recognize the key elements of the head of each m-function (provided 
	they conform to the syntactical rules documented in publishFS.m). Using publishFS.m, 
	the FSDA user can generate documentation pages for his/her new functions.<br>
	The extensive html documentation is perfectly integrated in the documentation 
	system of MATLAB. Therefore, FSDA functions are accessible from the standard 
	‘Function Browser’ of MATLAB, which is activated by typing shift+F1, are indexed 
	by the system and can be conveniently explored from the standard MATLAB search 
	box.<br><br>
	<h3>Description of use</h3>
	<br><br>FSDA is a MATLAB toolbox and it is therefore 
	used within MATLAB. Typically, the user writes new scripts and/or functions 
	including FSDA statements in an ordinary text file with “.m” extension, and 
	executes the code from the standard MATLAB Command Window with a single command 
	(the “.m” filename).<br>Many FSDA scripts automating steps of typical robust 
	statistics tasks are available for trial in the head of each FSDA m-function 
	and in example files.<br>As all MATLAB functions, FSDA functions accept input 
	arguments and return output arguments, for example:<br>function [out] = FSReda(y,X,bsb,varargin)<br>
	For many functions the set of input–output parameters is so rich that it is 
	neither convenient nor possible to treat them comprehensively in these introductory 
	pages. Details on a specific option is retrieved from the MATLAB Command Window 
	by typing<br>docsearch(‘option_name’)<br>The order with which the optional input 
	parameters are set does not matter.<br>Typically, even a well-trained practitioner 
	will make use of few of the optional parameters available. On the other hand, 
	a researcher will have the possibility to experiment with many internal variables 
	controlled by optional parameters, without being forced to touch the source 
	codes.<br>The use of very flexible and thus elaborated options is simplified 
	by the adoption of data types of increasing complexity. For example, option 
	“databrush”, which controls the interactive brushing features of the FSDA dynamic 
	statistical visualization tools, can be simply neglected if the purpose is to 
	produce traditional static plots, it can be set to a scalar (e.g. databrush=1) 
	to make a single data selection, or it can be set to a MATLAB structure (e.g. 
	databrush.persist=‘on’) to make an indefinite number of selections. In general, 
	when an option becomes a structure, the list of possible fields will be automatically 
	set to default values and the user will only have to set what is of interest.<br>
	The output parameters are dealt with by the same principle: when a function 
	generates a lot of information, this is organized in an output structure so 
	that the user can extract only fields of major interest.<br>A second modality 
	to use FSDA is through Graphical User Interfaces, to perform tasks interactively 
	through controls such as buttons and sliders. The user can develop GUIs for 
	FSDA using the standard MATLAB instruments. Few GUIs are integrated in the FSDA 
	distribution, but they are mainly designed for demonstration purpose.<p></p>
