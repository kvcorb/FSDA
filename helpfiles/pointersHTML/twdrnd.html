 with parameter space given by
 \[ï»¿
 (\alpha,\theta,\gamma) =
 \Big\{\;
 ]-\inf , 0[   \;\times\;  ]0,\inf[  \;\times\;  ]0,\inf[
 \;\Big\}
 \cup
 \Big\{\;

 The parameter space follows the Laplace transform formulation of Hougaard
 (1986) and Hougaard et al. (1997), The parameter $\delta$ crucially
 determines the characteristics of the Tweedie distribution. The family
 includes the continuous normal, gamma and inverse gaussian distributions.
 $\delta = 0$ is for the gaussian.
 $\delta = 1$ is for the poisson.
 $\delta = 2$ is for the gamma.
 $\delta = 3$ is for the inverse gaussian.</P><h2>More About</h2><P>
 The Tweedie distribution is a very flexible family defined on positive
 numbers which is potentially useful for modeling data arising from a
 plethora of different frameworks. The family encompasses very
 heavy-tailed distributions, as well as light-tailed (i.e.
 exponentially-tailed) distributions. In addition, the Tweedie
 distribution may even model data with structural zeroes, since for some
 parameter values it reduces to a mixed distribution of Dirac mass at zero
 and an absolutely-continuous positive distribution. This feature is
 especially appealing when dealing with data arising from socio-economic
 phenomena, which indeed may produce structural zeroes - for example,
 owing to truncation of small values of the observations.
 The Tweedie distribution is in the exponential family, and it is
 therefore useful in the generalized linear model framework. With
 this parameterization, the mean and variance for Tweedie
 variables are $\mbox{E}(X)=\mu $ and $\mbox{Var}(X)=\theta \mu ^ \delta$,
 respectively, where $\theta $ is the dispersion parameter and $\delta$ is an
 extra parameter that controls the variance of the distribution.
 Except for the special cases mentioned above, the pdf for the Tweedie
 distribution does not have a closed form and can be expressed in terms of
 series; its evaluation then requires numerical approximations, which
 computationally are typically rather expensive . Dunn and Smyth (2005)
 use a finite series with a formula to determine the lower and upper
 indices to achieve the desired accuracy. Alternatively, Dunn and Smyth
 (2008) apply the Fourier transformation on the characteristic function.
